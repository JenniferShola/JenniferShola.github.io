Shola Oyedele is a Scholar at Open AI. Prior to her current role, Shola worked as a software engineer and engineering consultant for IBM, where she developed machine learning tools for companies in the tech and manufacturing industries. Shola joined the Scholars program because she wanted to deepen my engineering craft and to do that, I felt that it was necessary to build her intuition and knowledge of deep learning.

Shola also felt like the tooling needed to support AI commercially (as experienced in her previous position) was lacking in its ability to operate safely and predictably in way that allowed consumer technology to make as much progress as expected. By being apart of the Scholars program, Shola hopes to grow her deep learning expertise well enough to build the type of AI systems she plans to meet in the wild.

Shola also worked as a Software Engineer at Walker & Company (acquired), Intuit, Jawbone, and Docmunch (acquired). Shola holds a BS in Science, Technology & Society (Computer Science concentration) from Stanford University.
