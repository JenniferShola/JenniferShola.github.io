Shola Oyedele is a Scholar at Open AI. Prior to her current role, Shola worked as an engineering consultant for IBM, where she developed machine learning tools for companies in the tech and manufacturing industries. Shola joined the Scholars program because I wanted to deepen her engineering craft and to do that, she felt that it was necessary to build her intuition and knowledge of deep learning. 

Shola also felt that the tooling needed to support AI commercially (as experienced in her previous position) is lacking in its ability to operate safely and predictably in way that prevents AI from making as much progress as expected. By being apart of the program, Shola hopes to grow her deep learning expertise well enough to build the type of AI systems she wants to meet in the wild. Shola also worked as a Software Engineer at Walker & Company (acquired by Proctor and Gamble) and Intuit. Shola holds a BS in Science, Technology & Society (Computer Science concentration) from Stanford University.
