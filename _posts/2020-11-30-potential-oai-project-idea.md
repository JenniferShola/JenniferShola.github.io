Questions I ask myself to evaluate a project idea and research area

Once you have an idea, ask yourself:

Could it be that I found my area of focus within AI? What's ironic is that the other scholars mentioned something about multi-agent interactions during my first week in the program but I didn't understand the terminology. I thought it was more complicated but now, I feel more at ease with the concept.
