I could overly organize a learning schedule but that would take time away that could be spent learning and executing. To maximize my efforts in development, I've decided to take a different approach from how I historically study.

Here are a few principles I plan to abide by.

1. Exploration

   - I haven't always honored exploration in my academic pursuits so I really want to do that at Open AI. I don't want to rush the process or focus on producing. This time is about learning, exploring different methods and understanding which area of AI is a match for my interests and skill sets.

2. Sprints

   - Gentle pressure is good. The sprints cycle is familiar to me and I think establishing a routine would enable me to best make slow, consistent progress towards my research goals. Instead of lofty goals, I am only planning 2 weeks ahead at a time.

3. Stay Applied

   - I love to read but coding implementations are often the best way for  me to learn. During the program, I'm going to focus on trying to build algorithms in parallel to what I'm learning so that I can test my knowledge and reproduce the research.

That's it!

Now I'm off to setup Docker (:whale:)...
or stress about not setting it up fast enough or something...
