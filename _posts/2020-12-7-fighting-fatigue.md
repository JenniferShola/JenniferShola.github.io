I spent two months learning AI and all I got was a headache... daily. I knew learning AI would be hard but I didn't realize it would be painful. In fairness to AI, it's not just the subject matter. It's the pandemic, staying indoors all day, most days. It's the eye strain from staring at a computer screen for too long, reading research papers in bad lighting, and around-the-clock watching my favorite Netflix series to pass the time. As luck would have it, all my favorite things to do usually require a computer screen and headphones, which I've recently learned is a sure fire way to burnout nine months into a pandemic.

I am mentally fatigued.

I am physically exhausted.

Which brings me to my next point, we're still in a pandemic. Life has become as normal as one would expect (given the circumstances) but it's still created an environment that is more stressful and limited than normal.

Let this post serve as a friendly reminder that feeling stress in the research environment is **normal**. As researchers and engineers, we work on some of the world's most difficult problems. It can be quite easy to get consumed in the work, take on the world's problems, and ignore your own needs, especially when the solution is close.

In today's post, I wanted to challenge you not to do that but honestly, if you're reading this, you probably *already* have. If you find that you've already arrived at a point of mental or physical exhaustion, consider doing one or more of the following:

1. **Name it.**

      Are you mentally fatigued? Are you physically exhausted? How did you get here? Knowing where you are and what caused it makes it easier to understand how to prevent it earlier. You don't have to be at burnout to take a break. Being tired or feeling drained is enough of a reason.

2. **Go tech-less for a day and rest.**

      This one is simple. Shut off all of your devices and allow your body (or mind) to find the activities and movements that are complimentary to the state it's in. Giving yourself the chance to break away from digital stresses will allow you to more accurately understand what your body is trying to tell you.

3. **Add magnesium (and other nutrients) to your diet.**

      Headaches, fatigue, and muscle aches are all signs that the body and mind are overworked or nutritionally underfed. If you're finding yourself battling more colds than necessary, consider leveraging vitamins to provide you with the much needed boost. If you're battling mental fatigue, my personal recommendations are to make sure you're getting enough magnesium, omega 3s, vitamin d (especially for darker skin people who typically need more vitamin d than average) and iron (especially for women who typically have lower iron levels).

4. **Drink more water.**

      I'm sure I'm the umpteenth person to say this to you so I'm not going to explain it. Just do it. Being dehydrated doesn't help a tired body and mind.

5. **Introduce walks and other small breaks into your routine.**

      The pomodoro technique is one of the best frameworks to seamlessly add breaks into one's work day. I've written about the pomodoro technique and many of it's benefits of it and walking in a previous post, [How to Read Research Papers & Learn More Effectively]({% post_url 2020-10-25-learning-how-to-learn %}).

6. **Change your environment and do something fun.**

   Sometimes it's not you. It's where you are and what you're doing. The best way to disrupt that is to go somewhere new and do something fun and exciting. Don't hesitate to go off script when you need to, work will always be there.

If you're still not convinced, here is one of my favorite YouTube videos about [why you're always tired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js2vfr96iAQ) and how to fix it.

Chronic fatigue is something that has become normalized in our society but it shouldn't be. If you find yourself here, just know it's normal but it's also your responsibility to get yourself back to healthy.

I'm rooting for you!
