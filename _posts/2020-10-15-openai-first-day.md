The engineer in me is telling me to set up my environment and start working on *literally* anything. The perfectionist in me is hearing the other scholars speak about *multi-agent something or other* and I'm freaking out!

Today is Day 3 of the [Open AI Scholars](https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars-spring-2020/) program. The Open AI Scholars program is a 6-month full-time paid opportunity to study deep learning and open-source a project under the guidance of Open AI mentors. I learned about the opportunity by chance;  was reading this amazing [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) on BERT and the author happened to tag Open AI. That's how I discovered it.

It's been a mix of emotions since then - excitement, nervousness, trepidation. Its barely been one month since I applied and was accepted into the program so it still feels a bit surreal, yet timely. The pandemic pushed me to focus on my interests and it led me straight to AI and the future world created by it.

Building the future you imagine takes expertise so I am deeply grateful to Open AI for the opportunity to invest in myself.

So here I am... investing in my craft and hoping it helps me become a better engineer. :robot:
