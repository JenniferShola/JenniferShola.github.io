Today I gave a talk at the [Debug 2020 Summit](https://lesbianswhotech.org/debug2020/). It was titled *The Next Wave of Innovation: How Older Companies Are Using Silicon Valleyâ€™s Own Tools Against Them.* The post below explores some of the concepts presented today and my commentary on what's commonly excluded from that narrative.

One of the key components of my presentation was the rise of technology consulting. While companies like Accenture would argue that this has always been a staple of the industry, I'd argue that we've seen a tremendous shift in the type of technical consulting services being offered within the last 5 years. As the success of Silicon Valley has mounted, heritage brands (older, nontechnical companies) have become less and less hesitant of technology changes and over time, more aggressive on looking to technology to augment their businesses. In the absence of the technical talent needed to maintain these systems, most brands have turned to consulting firms to procure the technical expertise necessary to compete with the tech sector.

### Why does it matter

While most eyes are on the next unicorn from Silicon Valley, I argued that the next pioneer in business will be a heritage brand that transitions into a tech company. This will occur because:

**The most valuable resource is data.** The new economy is digital. The transition has been long in the making but it is only within the past decade or two where we've adopted data as a digital commodity. The tech sector has built the infrastructure for the data economy, raising the barrier for competition. Big businesses, with access to large amounts of data, have the competitive advantage in the market opportunities of the future.

**Data is the advantage and heritage companies have it.** Although tech companies have had the advantage of software that can easily extend to capture consumer data, heritage brands are beginning to replicate these models and using technology consulting to do it. What's more, these brands are building around their company's legacy of knowledge, magnifying their influence in a way that's exceeds their tech competition.

**Brand loyalty and domain expertise will always prevail.** Particularly in the arenas of content, heritage brands have the advantage through decades of brand loyalty and trust. In my talk, I argued that many heritage brands are going bankrupt due to growing operational inefficiencies and misunderstandings of the changing consumer base. However, they are not going out of business because of the brand itself. I'd argue that there are many brands, particularly the Chanels of the world, that consumers desire to see more of in the digital communities they're building.

**Removing the tech industry's advantage is a necessity.** There is a place for Heritage brands in the digital economy and it's up to the brands themselves to adopt to the changing landscape. Operational inefficiencies, particularly those that are solvable with technology, can not survive in the next wave of business. The heritage brands who begin to build data infrastructures and explore business models built off of that platform will grow to be able to compete with the tech companies that once challenged them.

Disney is a classic example of this. Within one year, Disney reached 73 million subscribers for their streaming service, just under 40% of Netflix's 193 million. It's companies like Disney, Walmart, Chanel, etc. who are adopting business models and internal structures to support tech-lead initiatives. Heritage brands no longer have the space to scoff at technology. They must reposition or be replaced, and that is what is driving the next way of innovation.

As heritage brands fight to stay alive, technology consulting is a booming service, changing the question of what's possible and who will engineer it.
