**TL;DR** Navigate [below](#practical-tips-on-how-to-learn) for practical tips on how to study more effectively. Navigate [here](#practical-tips-for-reading-research-papers) to learn how to read research papers effectively. At the bottom of the page is a [list](#highly-recommended-resources) of recommended resources.

### Embrace being a beginner

Applying to the scholars opportunity at Open AI was a no-brainer. It was exactly what I was looking for: an opportunity to switch into a more AI focused role, an opportunity to study deep learning full time, and an opportunity to network and meet other like minded individuals passionate about AI. It was a no-brainer and yet, *still* intimidating. When you have worked in industry for some time (and even if it hasn't been that long), it can be very difficult to start again.

Becoming a beginner is daunting. So daunting that I imagine it's *why* I hadn't already started the journey. Because to start again, to truly admit that you know little more than that one random ML framework is tough. It taps into a fear that has little to do with the subject matter, but everything to do with the fear of failing, the fear of having to start over, and the fear of being a beginner again.

But we are all beginners in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We are **all** building the runway as we drive down the road and that fact must not be forgotten. You are not out of place because you don't know it all; You are *perfectly* in position, learning to build just as the ground settles.

If you can only take away one thing today, please let it be this quote by Einstein.

>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it.”

I first heard this quote many years ago. Then, I thought he was talking about money and capital investments. Now, I realize that the concept he refers to applies to *anything*, including time.

Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, **interest on interest**. If one can learn to invest in their craft, one will eventually see the compounded effect of focused time in their craft. It's not about getting there fast or aiming for some measure of expertise, it is **only** about compounding your efforts.

To aid in the growth of my craft, I invested some time in learning how to learn most effectively, the idea being that by optimizing my learning by 1%, I could gain an extra 1% of growth at every turn. Anecdotally, it has been **extremely effective.** I'd argue I'm at least 40-50% more effective then usual.

Please review the advice below. I sought out experts on these topics and summarized their findings below. I hope it helps you as much as it helped me.

### Practical Tips on How to Learn

[Barbara Oakley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw&ab_channel=TalksatGoogle) has a fantastic lecture at Google where she talks about her research around learning how to learn. She is a best-selling author who has taught millions of students around the world how to learn hard topics like engineering.

**This is what I learned:**

- [10 Rules of Good Stuying](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf): This is quick and easy list of tips on how to study. Read it. Print it. Hang it on your wall. I won't reguritate it here because it's already well assembled.

- There are two modes of the brain: **focused mode** and **diffused mode**. Focused mode is the mode characterized by focused attention. Diffused mode is the mode of thinking rhar allows for one to build new thinking paths. The brain can only be in **one** mode of the brain at once. Powerful study habits is learning how to tap back and forth between the two modes since **both** are necessary for effective learning.
  
    Example: Consider the times when you stop working on a problem, only to find the answer *as soon as* you start again. This aha moment is usually created by us having finally switched out of the focused mode long enough for our diffused mode to help us solve the problem at hand.

- Use the **[pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)** to get rid of procrastination. Your goal is not to complete a task; your goal is to stay focused for a set amount of time. For 40 minutes, I work uninterrupted. For 20 minutes, I relax.

- **Use your pomodoro leisure time effectively**. In the leisure time (15-20mins), I try to do things that are already on my to-do list. For example, I'll stretch and do yoga ([via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzm3fA2HhkQ&t=361s&ab_channel=YogaWithAdriene)) to reset myself mentally.

    If someone gives me a call during my focused pomodoro time, I usually offer to call them back at the end of my pomodoro (in X minutes). Few people object and I find that a fun conversation with a friend is a great way to disconnect.

    Of course, bathroom breaks and lunch are also options but I've found these unexpected ways to unwind to be the most fruitful.

- **Try digital co-working** and [study with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9JKThFZmio&ab_channel=MDprospect) opportunities. You don't have to work alone in 2020. Studying online with people in digital co-working spaces or following along with a YouTube Study with Me has led to some pretty epic study sessions.

- **Practice everyday in small increments**. Stay away from marathon studying. It's draining and you're less likely to recall the information than if you studied in **small chunks** over a longer period of time.

### Practical Tips for Reading Research Papers

The most effective way I've found to read research papers is by reading them in multiple passes. In each pass, you're trying to learn something different from the paper. I learned about this strategy from [Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI&ab_channel=stanfordonline) and I'm personally sold on it.

Reading papers used to be a daunting activity that would take me several hours from start to finish and sometimes multiple days. Now, it takes me about an hour or less to do the final read of the paper (with notes) and prior reads don't take long enough for me to time.

**Here is the process:**

1. **Read the title, abstract, and figures.**

    Goal: Your goal is to understand the high level of what the paper is presenting.

    You don't need to take notes.

2. **Read the introduction, conclusion, figures, and skim** the rest of the paper.

    Goal: Your goal is to skim the paper and understand the high level *details* of what the paper is presenting.

    You shouldn't take any notes. I usually re-read the title and abstract, and then read the headlines and occasionally the first line of paragraphs and sections that seem interesting. It might be tempting to read more but I don't suggest it. It's best to focus on understanding what the authors have done at a high level.

3. **Read the paper. Skip the math.**

    Goal: Your goal is to read the paper thoroughly. Take notes but skip the math and any part you don't understand.

    By this point, repetition will have become your friend. Having read the key pieces of the paper multiple times, it will make reading the rest of the paper easier. It'll also feel as if you're already familiar with what the paper is proposing and make this read much faster. I also tend to look up any definitions that appear (but aren't defined) in the paper; I find that these terms can usually be understood after a quick Google search.

4. *(Optional)* **Implement the paper** and/or read the paper focused on the most difficult parts.

    Goal: Your goal is to apply what you've learned and/or deepen your theoretical knowledge of the topic. If you don't implement the paper, read it again but focusing on the math and any areas you didn't understand.

    I have found this point to not be needed (for most papers). Typically, I re-implement the algorithm presented in the paper if it's a wide-used one (such as ResNet) but otherwise, I focus on applying what I've learned into new models.

5. **Review the paper by answering these questions.**

    Goal: To summarize the paper in your own words. I typically write the answer to these questions at the back of the paper.

    1. What did the authors accomplish?

    2. What are the key elements of the approach?

    3. Which concepts can you use in your own research?

    4. What other relevant work referenced in the paper do you want to follow?

6. **Bonus Tips:**

- You can usually tell if the paper is interesting or significant and relevant by the 2nd pass. If it's not relevant to your learning, don't force yourself to read the whole thing. Papers can become outdated quickly and it's normal to come across something that is no longer relevant to what you're working on.

- In contrast to the previous point, *[transfer learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/)* is a powerful concept. There is still much to be gained by learning about what other researchers have tried, as it helps to round out your knowledge in the space. Be careful with how you decide what is important vs unimportant to learn.

- Try to group the research papers you read by topic so that you are able to expand your understanding within a sub-field vs having to start from scratch when reading papers from different sub-fields within AI (i.e. NLP vs CV).
