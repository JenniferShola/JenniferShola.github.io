## Refreshers

I watched some videos to refresh my knowledge on neural networks.

[But what is a Neural Network? | Deep Learning, Chapter 1 (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) - general overview. 3Blue1Brown is literally *the* best channel for learning concepts in deep learning.

[ResNet Architecture (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tBPSxioIZE&ab_channel=deeplizard) - helpful overview of ResNet Architecture

[Building ResNet Conv Block Details (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSXl8S4ZwqQ&ab_channel=PitaKibunja) - helpful on understanding how to build the classes.

Residual Connections (are connections that allow gradients to flow directly through to a network)
