## GANs

### A Brief Explanation of GANs

General Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning techniques that consist of two networks playing an adversarial game against each other. Both the discriminator and the generator are simultaneous trained.

GANs can be used in:

- Data augmentation
- medical applications (privacy)
- semi-supervised learning (SGAN)
