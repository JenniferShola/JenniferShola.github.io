##### Prince Georges County, MD

I'm from a little suburb in Maryland just outside of Washington, DC. As a kid, my aunt would take my cousins and I on a day trip, visiting one of the city's museums for the day. Much of my summers were spent at the exhibits, watching movies about dinosaurs and collecting random tidbits on science and history. I'm not sure *when* it started but it's probably *where* most of my dreams of the future began.

As a teen, I wanted to be a biomechanical engineer. I always thought it would be cool to build surgical robotics, removing much of the unpredictability of real time health care.

When I entered college, I asked my sister (a doctor) what it would take for me to build the type of machines I wanted to see in the world and her answer was simple, "You need to become a doctor or a PhD." I didn't want to do either.

I found computer science that year but in hindsight, I still didn't understand how much computer science could help realize the future world I imagined. Years later, I'm still discovering the possibilities that AI presents.

This blog chronicles my journey in AI. I hope it serves as a roadmap for people entering the field and for peers who wish to learn from new voices. I'm excited to be on this journey and glad that you've come along for the ride.

God speed. :robot:
