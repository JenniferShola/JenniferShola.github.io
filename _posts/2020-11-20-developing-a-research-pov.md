- developing bad research ideas / building a perspective on research (not adopting the POV of others but recognizing the wisdom in it)

blurring the line between opinions of the future vs hard rules about the past

developing unique POVs, keeping skepticism at bay, and learning about the social and political nature of current beliefs (XYZ has a good point even if he is a controversy figure)

## Commentary

why do ML papers and tools still think that a single clean, labeled training dataset is the solution to real-world ML problems? holding a training dataset constant is absurd when you’re regularly releasing models. data comes in streams, not tables!

reproducibility - the same prompt to a model can generate a different answer days or weeks apart due to the parameters and feature sets changing between cycles

ML research kinda preaches the opposite — people are exploring how to throw all the data they have at huge neural nets and then prune these models to make them smaller & maintain similar performance

can a model self prune

if a model can point out data that didn't help it achieve its results (or had minimal impact), can it find correlations between the ejected data and the remaining data. is there a way to generalize the findings to understand how to reliably predict which data is not helpful for solving the problem / achieving general NLU

but more often than not, only a small fraction of the data is actually predictive, and it’s more important to develop intuition for the specific task and tease out important features & how they interact with other features. starting small gives insight into what the model does
