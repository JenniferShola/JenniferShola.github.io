I feel like I don't know anything. 

The engineer in me is telling me to set up my environment and start working on *literally* anything. The perfectionist in me is hearing the other scholars speak about *multi-agent something or other* and freaking out. 

Before I tell you how I got here, let me tell you how it began.

### Where It Started
<i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Prince Georges County, MD. 

I'm from a little suburb in Maryland just outside of Washington, DC. As a kid, my aunt would take my cousins and I on a day trip, visiting one of the city's museums for the day. Much of my summers were spent at the exhibits, watching movies about dinasaurs and collecting random tidbits on science and history. I'm not sure when it started but it's probably where most of my dreams of the future began. 

As a teen, I wanted to be a biomechanical engineer. I always thought it would be cool to build surgical robotics, removing much of the variability of real world conditions. It was a dream of mine but somewhere along the line, it didn't seem possible. When I entered college, I asked my sister (a doctor) what it would take for me to build the type of machines I wanted to see in the world and her answer was simple, "You need to become a doctor or a PhD." I didn't want to do either. 

I found computer science that year but in hindsight, I still didn't understand how much computer science could help realize the future world I imagined.


### Where I am Now
Today is Day 3 of the [OpenAI Scholars](https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars-spring-2020/) program. It's been a mix of emotions - excitment, nervousness, trepidation. Its barely been one month since I applied and accepted into the program. I was reading this amazing [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) on BERT -- Don't be intimidated, I didn't and still don't fully understand transformers yet. I've dabbled with AI over the years (even built a few ML models) but I didn't (correction: don't) feel confident in my skills. 

I found the Scholars program at a time where I was ready for a major change. I wanted to build the future I once imagined and doing so required me to build the expertise. 

So here I am... investing in my craft and hoping it helps me become a better engineer.  

### How I Prepared

###### [Fast AI](https://fast.ai/) by Jeremy Howard
I found the course's top-down approach to teaching deep learning  one of ***the best*** courses that will get you bulding highly-tuned ML models quickly. It's also jam packed with insights and the same best practices that has made him on of the best data scientists in the future. If you're unsure where to start as an engineer, start [here.](https://course.fast.ai/)  

###### Coursera's Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng
This one wasn't my favorite but it's highly rated and made the math feel more intuitive. 

###### [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Page-Machine-Learning-Book-ebook/dp/B07MGCNKXB) 
I found this book to be a really good survey of the fundamentals of the field. It's a quick read; it's a great way to get comfortable with the terminology, esp if you're coming from a non-engineering background. 

###### Be A Software Engineer*
So I didn't originally add this one but I thought I'd come back to state the obvious. I don't actually think you need to be an engineer to learn deep learning. I think it only helps as it's one less thing to learn -- but I did want to caveat that.  


### My Plan Of Action
I don't have a plan yet but I do have a few principles I plan to abide by. 

1. Exploration
- I haven't always honored exploration in my academic pursuits so I really want to do that at Open AI. I don't want to rush the process or focus on producing. This time is about learning, exploring different methods and understanding which area of AI is a match for my interests and skill sets. 
2. Sprints
- Gentle pressure is good. The sprints cycle is familiar to me and I think establishing a routine would enable me to best make slow, consistent progress towards my research goals.
3. Stay Applied
- I love to read but implementation is often the best way to learn. During the program, I'm going to focus on trying to build in parallel to what I'm learning so that I can test and make sure I can reproduce the theory.

That's it! 

Now I'm off to setup Docker... 
or stress about not setting it up fast enough or something...
